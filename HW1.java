 * This program analyzes movie review data to determine if words have a 
 * negative or positive meaning. If a word is used more often in positive 
 * reviews, it is assumed that the word is positive, and vice versa.
 * Currently, it reads review data line by line - each line is a single review in teh form:
 * <integer rating of movie> <Written review - text supporting the rating> <newline>
 * 
 * <Add additional comments to further the purpose of this program.>
